Voron 2.4 Z tensioner bracket use M4 screw 

part of voron 2.4 reduce weight modded parts. Use M4 screw to mount the Z idler to top frame, instead of M5.

 
I realize the voron 2.4 is tooo heavyâ€¦..also I noticed there are a lot of M5 screws used.

In my opinion M4 should be strong enough for many places.

I just start making part mods to replace M5 with M4.

the Z idler seems to be the easiest, and it can help us replace 8 M5 X 30mm long screw.

a lot of weight should be reduced.

 

hardware needed:

M4 button head 30mm long screw X 8

T nut M4 X 8.

 

and you will get back M5 30mm long X 8  and T nut M5 X 8.
