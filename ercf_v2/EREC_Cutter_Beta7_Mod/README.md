# EREC Cutter beta7 mod 

## What:
 for ERCF V2 / ERCF Filament Cutter Beta7 https://github.com/kevinakasam/ERCF_Filament_Cutter
 
 * it fixed or improved a few problem in the beta7 design
 * it works with my ERCF V2  28mm servo mod, since my 28mm servo mod selector has a thicker body, also stronger screw mount holes on top.
 

## New changes comparing to ERCF Cutter Beta7
  
  * the cutter beta7 need to change the encoder case once a few months, in different releases, I think this should be avoided since ERCF encoder case is may have other mod , it's not easy to print and put in heat insert M3 multiple, and endstop screw need to be precisely adjusted. the idea is to make the encoder case stable and don't change.
  * in order to support new features in beta7, also avoid touching/changing the encoder case, I made a adapter part, so encoder case stays.
  remove
  * in order to make it works with my 28mm servo MOD thicker selector body , I made a different servo base part.
  * to remove the built in support in the beta7 design, which is quite difficult to remove and dangerous, the modified gear part now can be just printed, without any support. 
  * in beta7 , the cutter blade/knife need to be cutted or break the front tip, which is very dangerous and not convenient. this mod removed this requirement, not needed.
